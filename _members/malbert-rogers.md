Iâ€™m a Bioinformatician in the BioIT group of the Medical Microbiology Department at the UMCU.

My main task is to provide bioinformatician support to (non-bioinformatician) researchers of our department. This does also include tasks such as setup and maintenance of pipelines and provide (basic) bioinformatics education. My main area of expertise at the moment is metagenomics (microbiome) related researches.
